## R programming: Assignment 2_ Matrix Inversion_20150822

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to 
##  caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly
##  Assignment: is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

##    For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
              x <<- y
              m <<- NULL
        }

        get <- function() x
        setmatrix <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getmatrix <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get, setmatrix = setmatrix, getmatrix = getmatrix)
}

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getmatrix()
        if (!is.null(m)) {
              message("getting cached data")
              return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setmatrix(m)
        m
}
